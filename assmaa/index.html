        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="bioText">
          I am an international computer science student with a primary interest
          in cybersecurity and system-level software. My work focuses on
          understanding how vulnerabilities arise in real systems and how they
          can be analyzed, exploited, and mitigated through careful design and
          experimentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am more interested in backend systems, security mechanisms, and
          low-level behavior than front-end development. Programming, for me, is
          a way to analyze system behavior, evaluate security assumptions, and
          improve the robustness of software systems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card content">
        <h2>Background & Interests</h2>
        <p>
          My project experience is mainly in cybersecurity and systems-related
          work. I have completed hands-on security labs and academic projects
          involving network attacks, operating system mechanisms, and
          vulnerability analysis. These experiences have strengthened my
          understanding of how real systems behave under adversarial conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond technical work, I have a strong interest in continuous learning
          and personal development. I speak multiple languages and enjoy using
          them in academic and cross-cultural environments. In my free time, I
          play the guitar, stay active through sports and fitness activities,
          and enjoy learning new skills both inside and outside of computer
          science.
        </p>

        <h2>Career Skill Development Plan</h2>
        <p>
          My current goal is to further develop practical cybersecurity skills
          by working on more advanced attack and defense scenarios, particularly
          in operating systems, networking, and secure software design. I aim to
          deepen my understanding of how security theory translates into
          real-world implementations.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the long term, I plan to pursue advanced study or research in
          cybersecurity, with a focus on vulnerability analysis, system
          security, and secure architecture design. My objective is to build
          expertise that allows me to assess and improve the security of complex
          software systems.
